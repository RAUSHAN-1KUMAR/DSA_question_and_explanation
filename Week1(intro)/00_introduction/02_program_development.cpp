/*
--> Programming paradigms/methodologies
    1. Monolithic programming, ex:- Basic
    2. modular/Procedural programming, ex:- C language
    3. Oject-oriented programming, ex:- C++ language 
    4. Aspect-oriented/component Assembly programming
--> What is Algorithm, Psuedocode and Program?
    * algorithm is a step by step procedural to solve a computational problem.(we can use any language here, people use pseudocode)
    * program is also a step by step procedural to solve a computational problem but instruction are according to the language selected and the 
      syntax which are followed in that language.
--> Flowchart:- flowchart is used for showing the flow of control of a program.
--> Steps for program development & execution:-
    1. Editing:- that is typing a program.(first.cpp).
    2. Compiling:- converting our code into machine code with the help of compiler.(first.exe).
    3. Linking Library:- copying of content(like cout, cin, whatever we have used in our code, which is present in our header file) in exe file.
    4. Loading:- for runnig our code/program it should be brought in our main memory(RAM).
    5. Execution:- after loading of our code in main memory, it runs.
    
    * All the above steps are done at a time with the help of softwares(IDE - Integrated Development Environment), we will VS Code software(IDE).
