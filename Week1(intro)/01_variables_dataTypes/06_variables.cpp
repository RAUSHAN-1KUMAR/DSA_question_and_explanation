/* variables:- variables is like a container where we store a value when our code is executed or 
               variable is the name of a memory location that we use for storing data.  

    int apples = 4; apple is variable name and int is its datatype(integer) and 4 is the value given.(declaration and initialization)
    apples = 5; Now the value of apple is changed to 5.
    
    int c; c is variable name and it is an integer but its value is not defined.(declaration)
    c = 3; now the value of c is defined and its value is 3.(initialization)

    
* Some rules to be followed when naming a variable.
    1. variable names should not begin with a number.
    2. whitespace(backspace) is not permitted in variable names.(we can use underscore(_))
    3. A c++ keyword(reserved word) cannot be used as a variable name.
    4. It is preferred to use variable names with more than one word with all lowercase letters for the first word.
       and capitalization of the first letter of each subsequent word.
    5. when creating variables, it is preferred to give them meaningful names.
    6. all lowercase letters should be used when creating one-word variable names.
    

C++ identifiers:- Names of class, variables, methods
* Points to remember about identifiers
    1. All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character($) or an underscore(_).
    2. After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.
    3. A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.
    4. The identifiers are case sensitive.
    5. Whitespace(backspace) is not permitted.
