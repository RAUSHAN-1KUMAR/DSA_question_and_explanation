/*
Things to remember in BST

1. In-order traversal of BST is always sorted in ascending order

2. for any subtree, or even for the main tree: 
    i) its maximum value will be at left most node
    ii) its minimum value will be at right most node

3. Searching in BST(logN) is more efficient than searching in BT(N)
