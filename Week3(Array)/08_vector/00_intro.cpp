/*
1. The Standard Template Library(STL) provides a collection of template classes and functions that offer common data structures and algorithms to make programming more efficient and convenient.
2. A vector in C++ is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size, making it a versatile and efficient data structure for storing and manipulation sequences of elements.

/*
Compile time and run time:-
    1. Compile Time:
        -- Compile time refers to the period during which the source code of a program is translated into machine code or bytecode by a compiler.
        -- During compile time, the compiler checks the syntax of the code, performs type checking, optimizes the code, and generates executable files.
        -- Errors detected during compile time are often syntax errors, type errors, or other issues that prevent the code from being successfully compiled into executable form.

    2. Run Time:
        -- Run time refers to the period during which the compiled program is executed by the computer.
        -- During run time, the program instructions are executed by the CPU, and data is manipulated and processed according to the logic defined in the program.
        -- Errors that occur during run time are often referred to as runtime errors and can include exceptions, memory access violations, and other issues that occur during program execution.
        -- Run time also includes dynamic memory allocation, user input, and interactions with external resources such as files, networks, and databases.

/*
Dynamic and static memory allocation:-
    1. Static Memory Allocation:
        -- Static memory allocation refers to the allocation of memory for variables at compile time.
        -- Memory for static variables is allocated before the program begins execution and remains allocated throughout the program's entire lifespan.
        -- Static variables are typically allocated in a region of memory known as the data segment or global memory.
        -- Examples of statically allocated variables include global variables, variables declared with the static keyword, and variables allocated outside of functions in C and C++.

    2. Dynamic Memory Allocation:
        -- Dynamic memory allocation refers to the allocation of memory for variables at runtime, typically using functions like malloc(), calloc(), new (in C++) or other similar mechanisms.
        -- Memory for dynamically allocated variables is allocated on the heap at runtime.
        -- Dynamically allocated memory is not bound to a specific lifetime and can be allocated and deallocated during program execution using appropriate functions (malloc(), free(), new, delete, etc.).
        -- Dynamic memory allocation is useful when the size of data is not known at compile time, when memory needs to be allocated and deallocated dynamically during program execution, or when memory requirements are large or variable.
