/*
1. If it says to find first negative, first maximum, first character etcc..... hind->first

2. If it says someone is not able to complete then it goes back in line 
    - if the guy who comes first and letter on didn't meet the condition then remove it or send back in queue

3. if you want to keep track of previous desired element, because it may happen that current selected element fails the condition:
    - then do think of queue

4. simulation i.e., queue m hi pop kerna h then push kerna h ya phir q m push ker rhe h then kuch operation ker rhe h


Queue ke question thoda confusing hote h, lagega ki code complete ho gya but may be galat ho.
