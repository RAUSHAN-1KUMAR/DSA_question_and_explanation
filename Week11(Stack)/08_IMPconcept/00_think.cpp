/*
1. If we have written brute force of O(n^2) and the inner loop for j 
    -  j = 0 to i
    -  j = i to 0
    -  j = i to n
    -  j = n to i  i.e., j = fun(i), think for stack to optimise it in O(n)

2. if you want to keep track of previous desired element, because it may happen that current element fails the condition:
    - then do think of stack or queue
