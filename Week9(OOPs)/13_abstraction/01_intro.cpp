/* Abstraction

1. Delivering only essential information to the outer world while masking the background details.

2. It is a design and programming method that separates the interface form the implementation.

3. Real life eg., various functionalities of AirPods but don't know the actual implementation/working .
    Eg., -> To drive a car, one only needs to know the driving process and not the mechanics of the car engine.
    Eg., -> header files we use in our codes.
