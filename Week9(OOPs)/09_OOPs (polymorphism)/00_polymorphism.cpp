/*
üîç What is Polymorphism?
    - Polymorphism means ‚Äúmany forms‚Äù ‚Äî it allows the same function or method to behave differently based on the context, object and input.

In C++, polymorphism allows you to use a base class pointer or reference to refer to objects of derived classes, and call the appropriate function based on the actual object ‚Äî not just the pointer type.



Polymorphism:-
    1. compile-time polymorphism(static polymorphism):-
        - Compile-time polymorphism is resolved during compilation. The most common examples of compile-time polymorphism in C++ are function overloading and operator overloading.

    2. Run-Time polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism):-
        - Run-time polymorphism is resolved during program execution. The most common example of run-time polymorphism in C++ is achieved through inheritance and virtual functions i.e., due to function overriding.

// Earlier we have already discussed the compile-time polymorphism in function overloading and operator overloading section

// now we will proceed towards run time polymorphism
