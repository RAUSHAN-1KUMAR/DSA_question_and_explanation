/*
A shallow copy is a copy of an object where:
    - All member(private, public, etc) variables are copied as-it is
    - static members and pointers are shared not copied 
    - pointers (only the address is copied, not the data it points to)

When is this a problem?
If your class contains dynamically allocated memory (e.g. int* data = new int;), a shallow copy will cause:
    1. Both objects to point to the same memory.
    2. Double deletion when both destructors run â†’ ðŸ’¥ crash or undefined behavior.
