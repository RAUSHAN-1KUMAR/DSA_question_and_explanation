/*
only data get copied, No, member functions are not copied â€” neither in shallow copy nor in deep copy.  
    - Member functions are shared across all instances.
    - They're part of the class's code section, not stored in each object.
    - When you create an object, only the data members (variables) occupy memory.
    - The function code is compiled once and reused by all objects.


// copy constructor add kerne ki need nhi h, default shallow copy kaam kerta h ache se. But copy constructor add kerne ki adat achi honi chahiye kyunki deep copy kerne ke liye

    // copy constructor but why byReference-> because if we use pass by copy it means our copy constructor will be called for srcObj, but our copy constructor is incomplete,(C++ will try to use the copy constructor again... which requires copying... which again calls the copy constructor... and so on...) that's why we use pass by reference.
    // why const?-> we can do without const but it's a good practice to use const because to make the srcObj constant i.e., read only, we can't modify it.
