/* DSU -> disjoint set union

Disjoint sets:- the sets whose intersection = null, -> Two sets are called disjoint sets if they donâ€™t have any element in common.

SO disjointSetUnion helps us in three ways:-
    i) combine two given sets: union()
    ii) find the leader/parent of the set: find()
    iii) find if two members , let say (b,g) , belong to same set or not. We mainly find representative of both and check if same: find()

    and that's why it is also called Union Find Algorithm

In this algo, there is a set exist and a leader/parent for each set, and leader is any of the member from that set only

/*
Approach:- Obtimising the height of the tree
    -- Lets use a rank vector to optimise the height of the tree so that the parent search can be dont at O(1) TC.
    -- initially the rant of each node will be same: 0 or 1 whatever

    Observe the change: 
        : we assignes parent[px]=py <- if rpx < rpy 
                   or parent[py]=px <- if rpy < rpx
                   or       any     <- if rpy = rpx and alos increase rank of top

            1. find parent of x and y: px, py
            2. find rank of px and py: rpx, rpy
            3. connect smaller rank to larger rank always

So ultimately we have improved the Union find of DSU by using rank and path compression
