/*
Spannning Tree: (only for undirected graphs)
    - A tree in which we have N nodes and N-1 edges and all nodes should be reachable from each other i.e., its connected and has no cycle.
    - there can be many possible spanning trees for a single graph.

Minimum Spanning Tree:
    - a spannning tree with the smallest possible total edge weight
