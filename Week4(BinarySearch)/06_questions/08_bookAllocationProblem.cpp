/* To allocate minimum no. of pages.

You have N books, each with A[i] number of pages. M students need to be allocated contiguous books, with each student getting at least one book.In each permutation, one of the M students will be allocated the maximum number of pages. Out of all the permutations, the goal is to find the permutation where the sum of maximum number of pages in a book allotted to a student should be minimum, out of all possible permutations.

Each book will be allocated to exactly one student. Each student has to be allocated at least one book.

Note: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible, and allotment should be in contiguous order (see the explanation for better understanding).


Examples:
    Input: N = 4, A[] = {12,34,67,90}, M = 2
    Output:113
    Explanation:Allocation can be done in following ways:
    {12} and {34, 67, 90} Maximum Pages = 191
    {12, 34} and {67, 90} Maximum Pages = 157
    {12, 34, 67} and {90} Maximum Pages = 113.
    Therefore, the minimum of these cases is 113 which is selected as the output

    Input: N = 3, A[] = {15,17,20}, M = 2
    Output:32
    Explanation: Allocation is done as
    {15,17} and {20} Mazimum pages = 32
    {15} and {17,20} Maximum pages = 37

/*
Approach:- 
    1. Brute force -> is to check iteratively all possible pages from max(pages[]) to sum(pages[])
        TC:- O(n^2)

    2. Better approach:-> apply BS in search space of max(pages[]) to sum(pagess[]) -> next solution
        TC:- O(nlogn)
