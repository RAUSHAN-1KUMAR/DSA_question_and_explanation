GCD/HCF:- greatest common divisor or highest common factor
    -- The greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the highest common factor (HCF), is the largest positive integer that divides two or more integers without leaving a remainder

    i.e., if x is the hcf of a,b then it means x is the largest positive integer that divides a and b both, x se bada aur koi nhi jo a aur b dono ko divides ker sake 
    
    [aur divide kerne ke baad further a and b kisi aur se divide nhi hoga siwaye 1 ke] -> IMP
