Sliding Window:-
    -- The sliding window technique is often used to solve problems related to finding subarrays or substrings with specific properties, such as maximum sum subarray, smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to a given value, longest substring with k distinct characters, etc.

    -- The basic idea behind the sliding window technique is to maintain a window of elements within the array or string and efficiently slide this window from left to right, or right to left, depending on the problem requirements.

    -- Sliding window problems often use a two-pointer approach, where two pointers (usually representing the left and right boundaries of the window) move through the data structure in a coordinated manner.
    
    -- The key advantage of the sliding window technique is its efficiency. It typically has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array or string, making it suitable for solving competitive programming problems with large input sizes

    -- the sliding window have two type:-
        1. when the size of the window is fixed and
        2. when the size of the window is not fixed
